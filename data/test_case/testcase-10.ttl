The challenge is to detect a conflict in the logical constraints. Alice is a
student and an employee. Alice is allowed to read a resource if she is a
student OR an employee. Alice is prohibited to read a resource if she is a
student AND an employee.<br>
The results are ambiguous: in some state to the world the policies are in conflict (
the sotw as provide), in other states of the world not (when alice is not student AND
employee).
