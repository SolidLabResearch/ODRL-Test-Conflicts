The challenge is to detect the conflict between a permission to pay with a
refinement to pay more than 10 euro and the obligation to pay with a 
refinement to pay less than 10 euro for a resource.<br>
Why is this a conflict? Due to deontic logic an obligation to pay < 10 euro is
entails a prohibition pay > 10 euro. This is in conflict with a permission to
pay > 10 euro.
